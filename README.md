# Ragtastic

Ragtastic simplifies the development of Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications, making it easy to integrate large language models and vector databases through an intuitive UI. Designed for data professionals and developers alike, Ragtastic accelerates the prototyping and scaling of generative search apps.

## Project Status
Ragtastic is currently in its alpha phase, under active development. We're working on core features and setting up initial builds. We're inviting users to test our basic UI on various platforms to ensure compatibility and gather feedback for further refinement.

### Features Under Development
- **Chat Session Management**: Manage chat sessions using popular LLMs like OpenAI's GPT models, Vertex AI, and Claude.
- **Data Import**: Import your data into a collection for real-time querying alongside chat sessions.
- **Dynamic Prompt Configuration**: Easily adjust the prompts used in chat sessions to optimize the interaction between users and the vector database.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: We're building Ragtastic to work seamlessly on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## Upcoming Features
- Integration with OpenAI API models (GPT-3.x, GPT-4.x)
- Support for Vector Database (e.g., ChromaDB)
- Enhanced chat session management tools
- User-friendly prompt/RAG configuration tools
- Desktop builds for Mac, Windows, and Linux

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI for robust API development.
- **Frontend**: React, utilizing Vite for fast builds and MaterialUI for sleek, intuitive user interfaces.
- **Desktop Application**: ElectronJS, enabling native desktop functionalities across different operating systems.
